fastinverse
===========

fastinverse_ is a small python extension for optimized interpolation of
data series for which each time point has up to N-th order derivative.

It generates fast C (C99) code for use tranparently from Python or for use
in external projects. For calculation of large number of inverse values
parallelization through OpenMP is used.

Capabilities
============
Fastinverse currently only generates one kind of solver: ``invnewton`` which is 
based on table lookup + newton iteration refinement.

invnewton
---------
InvNewton still has bugs (try changing to -0.7 and it works): 

`` python -m pudb invnewton_main.py -y 'tan(x)' -l 5 -o 3 --sample-N 1000 --x-lo -0.8 --x-hi 1.0 ``


Installation
============
To install run `python setup.py install`.
See distutils' documentation_ for more options.
