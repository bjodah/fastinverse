===========

fastinverse_ is a small python extension for optimized interpolation of
data series for which each time point has up to N-th order derivative.

It provides a c:a 5 orders of magnitude faster (albeit less general)
version of `scipy.interpolate.PiecewisePolynomial` (on my dual core laptop I get speed-up of 160 000x). 

See examples/perf.py for a quick head-on benchmark between those two
(expect a runtime on the order of half a minute).  The performance is
achieved through the use of multithreaded (OpenMP) C
 (with some equations generated through Sympy) and Cython.

Capabilities
============
Fastinverse currently only generates one kind of solver `invnewton` which is 
based on table lookup + newton iteration refinement.

invnewton
---------
InvNewton still has bugs (try changing to -0.7 and it works): 
``` python -m pudb invnewton_main.py -y 'tan(x)' -l 5 -o 3 --sample-N 1000 --x-lo -0.8 --x-hi 1.0 ```


Installation
============
To install run `python setup.py install`.
See distutils' documentation_ for more options.
